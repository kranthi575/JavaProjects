cbb18_19mini.csv contains statistics from the NCAA Men's 2018 and 2019 years

In this problem we are going to do the following:
1. Run ncaa.sql in MySQL Workbench to create a database.
2. Write a Java program that will connect to the database and read in the data
   for the cbb18_19mini.csv.
3. Write a JavaFX program that will allow a user to select year (2018 or 2019) and Conference
   The program will then display the teams in the conference and the champion, and
   teams who were in the final 4 for the particular year
